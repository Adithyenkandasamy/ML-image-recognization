📌 README: Image Classification with TensorFlow & Flask
🚀 Image Classification with Flask & TensorFlow
📖 Project Overview

This project is an image classification system built using TensorFlow and Flask. It takes an image as input, processes it using a trained deep learning model, and predicts the class of the object in the image with a confidence score.

🔹 Key Features:
✅ Accepts image uploads for classification
✅ Uses a pre-trained deep learning model
✅ Provides confidence scores for each prediction
✅ Deployable as a web application using Flask
🛠 Technologies Used

🔹 TensorFlow & Keras – Model training & prediction
🔹 Flask – Web framework for deployment
🔹 Python – Backend logic & scripting
🔹 NumPy & OpenCV – Image preprocessing
🔹 HTML, CSS, JS – Frontend (optional for UI)

🚀 Setup & Installation
1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone <https://github.com/Adithyenkandasamy/ML-image-recognization>
cd ML-Image-Recognition

2️⃣ Create & Activate a Virtual Environment

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

3️⃣ Install Required Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

🏗 Training the Model

If you want to train the model from scratch, use main.py:

python main.py

It will:
✅ Load the dataset
✅ Train a convolutional neural network (CNN)
✅ Save the trained model as trained_model.h5
🔍 Running Image Classification

Use test.py to classify an image:

python test.py --image test_image1.jpeg

Example Output:

'test_image1.jpeg' is classified as 'Laptop' with 99.88% confidence.
Other Predictions:
Backpack: 0.02%
Charger: 0.10%
Headphones: 0.00%
Water Bottle: 0.01%

🌍 Deploying with Flask

To serve the model as a web app, run:

python app.py

Then, open your browser and go to:

📌 Future Improvements

✅ Add a better UI for the web application
✅ Optimize the model for mobile devices
✅ Implement real-time image classification
